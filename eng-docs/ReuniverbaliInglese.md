🎯 Meeting Objectives

Define the basic movement and shooting mechanics.

Evaluate the structure of Level 1 and enemy types.

🧩 Decisions Made

Projectile management will be centralized in a BulletManager to optimize collisions.

2D canvas will be used instead of WebGL for easier initial development.

The player will be able to upgrade their weapon through a progressive power-up system.

Music will be composed in chiptune format, 1980s style.

🚧 Issues Discussed

Possible frame rate drops with too many animated sprites.

Lack of a boss spawn logic at the end of the level.

The difficulty scaling between levels still needs to be defined.
